# Projects Directory

This directory contains individual data science projects. Each project should follow the standard template structure located in `/templates/project-template/`.

## Project Organization

Each project should have its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
project-name/
├── data/           # Data files (raw, processed, external)
├── notebooks/      # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
├── src/           # Source code for the project
├── tests/         # Unit tests
├── docs/          # Project documentation
├── models/        # Trained models and model artifacts
├── reports/       # Generated reports and visualizations
└── README.md      # Project-specific documentation
```
