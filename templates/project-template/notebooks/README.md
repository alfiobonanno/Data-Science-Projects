# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and prototyping.

## Naming Convention

Use a numbering system to indicate the order of execution:

- `01-data-exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration
- `02-data-cleaning.ipynb` - Data cleaning and preprocessing
- `03-feature-engineering.ipynb` - Feature creation and selection
- `04-model-training.ipynb` - Model training and validation
- `05-model-evaluation.ipynb` - Model evaluation and comparison
- `06-final-report.ipynb` - Final analysis and results

## Best Practices

1. **Clear documentation** - Use markdown cells to explain your analysis
2. **Reproducible code** - Set random seeds and document dependencies
3. **Clean outputs** - Clear outputs before committing to git
4. **Modular code** - Move reusable code to the `src/` directory
